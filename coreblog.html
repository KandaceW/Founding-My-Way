                 <p> Hi and welcome to my core identity and values blog. </p>
                    
                <p>First off one value I hold in the most highest regard is without a doubt loyalty.
                This word loyalty is thrown around and disrespected by many but for me its everything.                         It can represent many other important values including integrity and honesty, two more words I hold dear to me. I feel if you show loyalty to something, someone  or even somewhere then this must mean its important to you. Or you have a connection or a history that defines a small or large part of you. If you have to earn loyalty or have your loyalty be earned it must mean something to you and the other party. Why is it such a big deal? To uphold loyalty is not hard, but it is rear and it is something that I have tried my entire life to keep my standards high and not let influences tell me what I know to be true or false.  I don’t give my loyalty away but I let it grow with anybody I meet. Everything and everyone  has the ability to gain my loyalty and give in return. I define Loyalty by some key words -trustworthy - dependability -honesty -integrity - unbreakable. In any case if you are loyal you will make the right decision for that moment.<p>
                <br>
                 <p>An example that I can think of to display what to me is loyalty from my perspective is  maybe the situation is I am in a room and someone that I do care for maybe gets mentioned  and perhaps in an incorrect and negative light, I  would stick up for my friend  in their absence. I would correct whatever was being said. I would not participate in any conversation about someone unless I was willing to say it to their face and I am not shy to speak the truth to anyone. My loyalty is within myself I will never go behind a friends back. Another example I can think of from the mouth of another is on my 21st  birthday party (sorry but I don’t remember much about my 21st) what I do remember is the first few lines out of my Fathers mouth during his speech. He started off with “ If there is one thing I could not say enough times over and the one thing that will not falter with Kandace is her tenacious and relentless Loyalty she she’s to those dear to her. It is unbreakable and with that loyalty if you have her on side she will make one hell of a guard dog “ he was and is right. My outspoken forward and assertive nature in-fact can be to my detriment sometimes although getting in trouble to up hold my values including on another behalf is never in my mind going to be the wrong decision.</p>    
                   <br>
                 <p>Another value and a identity defining factor about me is the importance of family. The word family means more than the people that raised you with the same blood. It’s also a choice you can make. I raise my children to believe that those close to us that we love respect and depend on, that we want to show loyalty to and care for from our hearts are the people that matter. They are our Family. I firmly believe you can pick your family. You are born without choice but as you grow and learn and see the good and evil in the world its important to address the ones you love and believe in you and remember them for one day when you may need someone if they are true they will be there for you. Everything is a choice. What and who you put your time and energy into will shape you and guide you and its all held in your Gut and Heart. As far as I’m concerned blood does not mean family.  Its an identifiable quality we all have but we also all have out own Minds and our own hearts and souls which far outweigh the red running through our veins. We are lucky if we have a family that we are born into that we can depend on it is unfortunately not always this way for some but as I said YOU CAN CHOOSE and you can establish your own roots and guide your own children and help shape them and create your family with those dear to you and around you!</p>

                 <p>While on this subject…. A bit of my family history about me!
                Kandace Ivy Willcox Born to Linda Troy Eccelston & John Stuart Willcox in Welington womans hospital 29/10/1984. One of 4 siblings in order - Michael, Myself, Toyah and Ashleigh. We were bought up in Wellington and I am proud of where I came from. I am 34 I have two children my daughter Alexandra  10 years and my son Luke 8 next week. Alex is amazing beautiful and honest soul she is wise and she’s also reserved with judgement. Alex is extremely close with her cousins and  any newbies added to the mix like blended family for example. my daughter reminds me daily about family values about strength in love and backing each other. My  gorgeous girl is an inspiration to me Im more than proud.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>My son Luke, he reminds me the small things don’t  matter his inner light and diversity Shine and when he enters the room so does a light and an energy of positivity and acceptance and light heartedness. He has this amazing giving nature and just says yes to things. Naturally so loveable he is well liked and holds family in very  high regard also. The reason Im sharing with you my feelings on my children is to show as part of my evidence on backing my own values mentioned above. If I see those qualities in my children  I have done something right I must have a strong influence in their way of thinking I raised them so far with their Father of course  but  I believe that strong influence from me and everyone around them including our self appointed family members their school friends and teachers and our community surrounding us is the influence and shapers responsible for who we all are.

                 When Asked for feedback for the Sprint evidence one of my friends that I asked replied with the message below within an hour. She is one of few I truly trust and believe trust me. Hopefully you get a perspective from someone that is in my Family although not by blood. Her name is Corinne we have been friends for five years + it’s a later in life friendship but from the day we met I really appreciated her “in your face” honesty. These are her words…. 
                <p>
                 “I don’t know how to put it...
                 I just think of you with your children! how when i first came to your home & saw all the cool family notes & artwork hanging  proudly from your walls & nutritional meals /recipes 4 the week planned  & helping roster on fridge with reasonable jobs 4 children to be involved in the meal process rostered clearly & evenly.
                 You remind me so much of myself as a working mum focused on providing the best tasty nutrition, with love & pride in their children thus creating & raising strong, kind, healthy & happy loving children. You've also shown me so much kindness, support when ive been down & non judgemental acceptance. Getting to know me & really knowing me, my morals & values & speaking up for my character in my absence.
                 You take the time to listen & learn about me. You're one of my nearest, dearest & most trusted fellow humans whom Im proud to call my gd friend.

                 Hayley another very dear friend wrote this to me. 
                 <br>
                 I have had the privilege of knowing Kandace for the last 7 years . Our friendship developing out of meeting in a professional capacity, growing into what I now view as a solid loyal friendship based on openness, trust and compassion. 
                 Kandace is a generous, kind, loving, loyal and passionate person who cares deeply about the welfare of those close to her. Her passionate trait in my view can sometimes put a negative spin on things as she will on occasion devote too much time to the issue at hand. However I also view this as one of Kandace’s best traits as I feel it is because of this passion that she is able to....think outside the square, creatively solve many problems any other person couldn’t even look at and find the good in people that some are often blind to thus making her life rich and full of diversity.
                 Kandace rarely gives up when the going gets tough and always encourages her friends to do the same when times are hard. Her generosity is off the scale, she is always there providing support in whatever way possible even if it means herself going without. 
                I believe     Kandace to be a hugely devoted   children are  a testament to her original, somewhat unorthodox, loving, energetic and fun parenting style. Because of this her well mannered, kind children light up the room with lives that are also rich in diversity, culture and knowing what things are truely important in life. 
                 Kandace is very good at making people feel good, believe in themselves and their abilities in achieving their desired outcomes. I’m not sure if she will agree but I would like to see her apply this more towards the way she views herself and her her own capabilities to achieve her goals going forward.
                 Reading these messages brought emotional feelings to the surface I got teary and this exercise has without doubt given me confidence to continue to believe in my values as a Human a Mother a Friend and an existing                  living breathing influence on those around me.

                 The Strengths that these Qualities bring out in me are dependability and support to those who need it they will add to my journey at Dev in a positive light because I will put forward my best efforts I will do what I say I will do and I will adapt when I need to for which my loyalty and Family values in place I can’t help but adopt so to speak any an all at dev that I endeavour to work along side! I can learn and be instructed I am fundamentally able to accept and help and nurture yet as a Leader I am Fair and very good and distributing the weight of a project. This comes from 18+ years as a hair dresser to which 10 of those years I have been Self employed. Over 3 go those 10 years I owned and operated a Salon with at times  up to six Staff members. My staff returned fairness to me they worked hard they were honest and I can say undoubtably they had  respect for me.

                 There was a dark time  for me towards the end of my ownership I was faced with a dilemma that really challenged me and my values. I had a toddler and a baby and I was facing single motherhood, I battled depression and anxiety and felt torn by my stubborness Loyalty to my staff and business. I felt scared and immense guilt that I was neglecting my kids and I felt ridiculous pressure that I had to put my responsibilities and obligations to staff whom depended on me for their livelihoods first. I realised pride was a big factor and when I spoke with my staff they showed me compassion, that they were thankful for me regardless and to do what is right! I sold the business and moved forward in my life and spent my time focused on my kids and I. I remained self employed but on a home basis and have do this for the past 5-6 years.m I don’t regret a thing now and I learnt a lot and consider it one of the hardest phases in my life. Its hard to think that for a few years when my kids were little and I owned a business, ran staff,  obeyed the law requirments, managed client relationships and a challenging personal relationship the I was actually un happy person, both within myself and outwardly to the world. I am an emotional person and this stirs up many many memories some painful, many feelings and emotions about that time. 
                 <br>
                 This is another reason EDA is were I want to be. To ask this of me shows they are wanting the right things from me as I do from them. People are the reason websites exist not technology People are what matter! I want to be apart of the future and shaping people in any way including through Technology! Thanks to the Dev Whanau for even just existing!
