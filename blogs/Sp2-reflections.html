                <h1>SPRINT 2 REFLECTIONS</h1>

                <h3> What is my long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>

                <p> To Develop a carreer in Tech. I initially wanted to learnhow to code and become invested in Internet Sequrity! This is to be my aim professionall. My creative side wants to know how to have fun or be able to code for a more productive
                    venture! Build apps or games or software in general for more comercial or user intrest based purposes.</p>


                <h3> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would i like to see developed in myself while at EDA? </h3>

                <p> Def my ability to focus and work more methodically at everything, Gaining consistancy and dependabilyity and completion of tasks.</p>

                <h3> A description of my own strengths and limitations </h3>

                <p>My skills with the core aspect of these learning competencies are my strengths to do with both school and in life. I have worked with needing to understand and communicate with people. Learning their needs, understanding what they are
                    truly saying and executing a service that they are happy to pay money for and return for another great result! I have been hairdressing 18 years nearly and I have clients that extend beyound the 12-13 yr mark. That must have something
                    to do with my personal corevalues!</p>

                <p>My limitations are somewhat conflicting charactoristics, hard to control and will win when I am feeling a lack of confidence or inner drive! </p>
                <p> My biggest limitations are Anxiety and procrastiantion! I can be overwhelmed by something one day that normally im not fussed by! This means i am unsocial and un achieving and on a whole I find hard to get out of this modeeven though I
                    am aware of being there.</p>

                <h3> Based on the above description, a commitment to how I will manage my workload is this.</h3>

                <p> I have reflected majorly on week 2 being somewhat a week I was unaware of till i started wrighting my Reflections. In dooing so i was able to work out why i had not got where I want to be! It was anxiety based and stress that clouded my
                    ability to focus! I think the way around this is to decide to make my life work out and do what i say and increase my ability to stay on task. Its going to make or break my succeess in this course. </p>

                <h3>I thought about and implemented some ways to help my focus. </h3>

                <p> To start - improve my environment. </p>
                <p> Routine my personal work load more - STICKING TO IT! </p>
                <p> The 3rd thing i have discovered while im blocked or find myself wandering is i start focusing on a number on a dart board, I aim to hit it a minimum of 3 times. It seems to clear out other crap cloggiong my thought process. </p>

                <p> The work load is daunting but only due to my tech side still undeveloped! I understand alot more than i can action at the moment. Still I dont look at it as a work load more of a list of learning tasks. I am finding it challenging but
                    this is not easy and honestly it hurts my brain but i am enjoying that feeling!</p>

                <h3> A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way. </h3>

                <p> I will be attending course as often as possible during foundations. Its an environment I like being in an small things I learn off peers can often lead to large breakthroughs! </p>
                <p>Ill be on slack more, the first week was brilliant and helped me alot and ill communicate with facilitators MORE FREQUENTLY IF I CAN NOT GET THROUGH A BLOCK!</p>

                <h3>A description of what I expect from the facilitation team.</h3>

                <p>My expectaions are more on the core I know they know the tech I need to be able to feel confident to aproach peole for help, able to talk and be understood. ~ Those are my expectation along with open minded non-judgmental communication
                    for all who surround me at course.</p>
