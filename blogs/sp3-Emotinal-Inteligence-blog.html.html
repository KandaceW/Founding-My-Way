        <h1>Welcome to my Emotional Inteligence Blog</h1>

        <h2><strong>My EQ View...does it show my I.Q.?</strong.></h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        <em>The difference between EQ in IQ</em> is the ability to feel and understand empathy and emotional presence in others and your self!
        <br> Alot of people have never her this term EQ or emotional IQ before, they may not naturally be aware due to up bringing and circumstance. To the extreem in some cases this is the oposite and many have an extensive knowledge. They
        may or may not display this in their everyday behaiviour. A lack of knowledge in emotional intelligence is common, yet I feel like I have always been aware of EQ. I dont think i new the terminology what exactly it was that I new till
        I was an adult and then a much further understanding and intrest developed when had children. My way of explaining my knowledge is by giving examples how its going to affect someone just in the way you phrase a centence. This is where
        Mindfulnes and attention training come into play. Ill use My Children as an example: I have always been very very careful with what I put on their lil shoulders and how my words effect them and especially other people that have little
        or no awarness of what they are actually saying. an example like so - Alex my Daughter was 8yrs old when her father rang me to say that he thought it about time we put rules in place about her privacy and who it was appropriate to
        get undressed and changed infront of. Ultimatley i had been thinking along the same myself. He initially wanted to introduce a blanket rule of "NO MALES!". I instantly dissagreed! My argument being it would give an incorrect view on
        Males. Especially since that is not the aim. He asked me why? I explained that to basket males and generalise them perhaps causing fear. I asked him "are you a preditor?" he was almost offended but then saw my point! Instead i sugested
        to him that we decide on a list of people tha will be appropriate and work off that. The list consisted of the likes of Mum, Nanna, close girl friends "if" she felt comfortable. Activities at school swimming events needed to be taken
        into acount etc, Aunties were exceptable, also her father would be appropriate if needed along with her brother until she felt otherwise etc. I also explained he need to introduce self awarness and her rights to privacy as she is gets
        older. Educating and introducing her to the idea that she can make choices about her own feelings and rights to her body will guide her to what essentially feels right or wrong. This was a far different result to the initial conversation
        her Father was planning to have.

        <em>One thing I want to make a special extra point of is - I had work yesterday and my Client Was Mrs Brenda Little. This lady who I have been doing her hair for over 10 years is a brilliant lady she a psycoligist and probly qualified in mainy different fields of therapy She runs her own practice and I believe her n I have always had great talks on things like Emotional Inteligence etc! Its was so so coinsidental and interesting that I did her hair yesterday, as I was talking about the course and how she would really be interested in the core aspects and aproach that dev take and we ventured into how I had to do mindfulnes etc. While we talked she informed me about how she is in practice to become qualified very soon in a method of therapy called Delta Wave! Its exactly the type of thing that this course could be interested in and she is so happy and offereed her amazing skills to do a session with the class. She gave me a site - Havening.org and 3 techniques of self touch that you do when you hit a block to change the fear and anxiety triggered in your brain which extends to cave man error.....create fear adreniline ...... Its to much to write about and i have time boxes to keep to so Ill find her web site link too and chuck it in quickly then move on but please consider this brilliant woman her offer is invaluable she is brilliant.
