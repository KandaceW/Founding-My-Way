       <br>

   <p> Typcal plan is based on a Fortnight period as this is dictated by my kids roster of 50/50 with their father The time table below is defined by 3 aspects Kids dpendant ~ My kids in my care and home Kids dpendant ~ my kids in my care but not dependant
    (school or out of house) Non Kids my off week These two screen shots show the weeks worth of commitments I have to my kids! //need to ink pics///

    I am 50/50 over a fornight but not a straight 7 days we chop n change here n there so to work around this means a lil bit of planning!  I have all but cut off any thing esle in my life but I will list now what I have scheduled!</p>

 <p>  My son Luke is 8 on May 4th id love to keep that Sat free for him I also have a stupidly timed trip away with my daughter in July right on final boot camp week so I will change that to later in July, I need to save up the funds!

As the weeks progress I will have to make decisions on working or not and fill the slots and move time around as needed but aways with the priority of 40 hrs dedicated to study. You will notice from my calendars that I have alot more time in my off week but that dosent mean much to me (YET) if I dont routine myself and plan my hours even with no restricted days then Ill just be frazzled or procrastination sets in which creates the thought prcess of 'Its Wed I still have 4+ days with 24 hrs a day to fit the
remanding 30+ hours in.... sweet as' this is classic "Kandace" procras-logic type thinking.
The only way I will finish this course is to live by the mentality of...  I must stick to what I obligate myself to achieve.

<h2>Reflection Questions Sp2</h2>
   <br>
<p><strong> Learning plan 2019</strong></p>

        <p> What is my long term goal and or career pathway? To Develop a carreer in Tech. I initially wanted to learnhow to code and become invested in Internet Sequrity! This is to be my intrest professionally. My creative side yearns to know how to have
            fun or be able to code for a more productive venture! Build apps or games or software in general for more comercial or user intrest based purposes.
            <br>
        </p> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would i like to see developed in myself while at EDA? Def my ability to focus n work more methodically at everything, thus ensuring consistancy and dependabilyity and completion of tasks.
        <br>
        <p> A description of my own strengths and limitations My skills with the core aspect of these learning competencies are my strengths to do with both school and in life. I have worked with needing to understand and communicate with people for a long
            time! Seeing their needs, understanding what they are truly saying and executing a personalised view that they are happy to pay money for and return for a second, third or 20ths time! I have been hairdressing nearly 18 years and I have clients
            that extend beyond the 12-13 year mark. That must mean something and have to do with my personal corevalues! My limitations are that my somewhat conflicting charactoristics are forever hard to deal with and will win when I am feeling a lack
            of confidwnce and or drive! My biggest liitations are Anxiety and procrastiantion! I can be overwhelmed by something one day that normally im not fussed by! This means i am unsocial and under-achieving and on a whole I find hard to get out
            of this mode even though I am aware of being there</p>
        <br>
        <p> Based on the above description, a commitment to how I will manage my workload below I have reflected majorly on week 2. Being somewhat unaware of how i felt other than upset and angry. Reflection to work out why i had not got where I want to be!
            It was anxiety based and stress that clouded my ability to focus! I think the way around this is to decide to make my life work out and do what i say and control my focus and increase my ability to stay on task. So to gain focus is the essential
            core element im striving to achieve. Its going to make or break my succeess in this course. I developed some little ways to help my mind balance and refresh, one being to improve my environment. Also my work load personally needs to be more
            routined. STICKING TO IT! The 3rd thing i did was start focusing on a number on a dart board and aiming to achive hiting that no. till I was zoned in! That really helped for IN THE MOMENT focus! The work load is daunting but only due to my
            tech side still slower that everything else! I understand alot more than i can action at the moment. I dont look at it as a work load more of a list of learning tasks. I am finding it challenginging butmy mindset is -<em>work is work and this is learning!</em>            This all hurts my brain but i am enjoying every second!

            <p> A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way. I will be attending course as often as possible during foundations. Its an environment I like being in an small things I learn their off peers can often lead to large breakthroughs!
                Ill be on slack more, the first week was brilliant and helpped me alot and ill communicate with facilitators MORE FREQUENTLY IF I CAN NOT GET THROUGH A BLOCK! A description of what I expect from the facilitation team. My expectaions are
                more on the core I know they know the tech I need to be able to feel confident to aproach peole for help, able to talk and be understood. Those are my expectation along with open minded non-judgmental communication for all surrounding
                me at course etc!
