   <p> Typcal plan is based on a Fortnight period as this is dictated by my kids roster of 50/50 with their father The time table below is defined by 3 aspects Kids dpendant ~ My kids in my care and home Kids dpendant ~ my kids in my care but not dependant
    (school or out of house) Non Kids my off week /Users/kiwdev/Desktop/Screen Shot 2019-04-24 at 9.36.00 AM.png /Users/kiwdev/Desktop/Screen Shot 2019-04-24 at 9.36.05 AM.png These two screen shots show the weeks worth of commitments I have to my kids! I
    am 50/50 over a fornight but not a straight 7 days we chop n change here n there so to work around this means a lil bit of planning!  I have all but cut off any thing esle in my life but I will list now what I have scheduled!</p>   
     
 <p>  My son Luke is 8 on May 4th id love to keep that Sat free for him I also have a stupidly timed trip away with my daughter in July right on final boot camp week so I will change that to later in July, I need to save up the funds! As the week/s progress
    I will have to make decisions on working or not and fill te slots and move time aroun as needed but aways with the priority of 40 hrs dedicated to study. You will notice from my calendars that I have alot more time in my off week but that dosent mean
    much to me (YET) if I dont routine myself and plan my hours even with no restricted days then Ill just be frazzled or procrastination sets in or I eliminate time with the thought prcess of for eg 'Its Wed Istill have 4+ days with 24 hrs a day to fit the
    remanding 30+ hours in.... sweet as' thi sis classic "kandace" procras-logic type thinking. the only way I will finish this course is to live by the mentality of...  I must stick to what I obligate myself to achieve.   Reflection Questions Sp2

<p><strong> Learning plan 2019</strong>

            <p> What is my long term goal and or career pathway? ~ To Develop a carreer in Tech. I initially wanted to learnhow to code and become invested in Internet Sequrity! This is to be my aim professionall. ~ My creative side yerns to know how to have
                fun or be able to code for a more productive venture! Build apps or games or software in general for more comercial or user intrest based purposes.
            </p> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would i like to see developed in yourself while at EDA? ~ Def my ability to focus n work more methodically at everything, thus ensuring consistancy and dependabilyity and completion of tasks.

            <p> A description of my own strengths and limitations ~ My skills with the core aspect of these learning competencies are my strengths to do with both school and in life. I have worked with needing to understand and communicate with people. seeing
                their needs understanding what they are truly aying and executing a personalised view that they are happy to pay money for and return for a second, third or 20ths time! I have been hairdressing 18 years nearly and I have clients that extend
                beyound the 12-13 years mark. That must mean something and have to do with my personal corevalues! ~ My limitations are that my somewhat conflicting charactoristics are forever hard to control and will win when I am feeling a lack of confidwnce
                and or /drive! My biggest liitations are Anxiety and procrastiantion! I can be overwhelmed by something one day that normally im not fussed by! This means i am unsocial and un achieving and on a whole I find hard to get out of this mode
                even though I am aware of being there</p>

            <p> Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this ~ I have reflected majorly on week 2 being somewhat a week I was unaware of till i started wrighting my Reflections. In dooing so i was able to work
                out why i had not got where I want to be! It was anxiety based and stress that clouded my ability to focus! I think the way around this is toe decide to make my life work out and do what i say and control my Focus and increase my ability
                to stay on task. So to gain focus is the essential core element I am eeding develop. Its going to ake or break my succeess in this course. ~ I developed some little ways to help my mind re centralise and refresh and one of thoes this was
                to improve my environment. Also my work load personally needs to be mor routined. STICKING TO IT! ~ The 3rd thing i did was start focusing on a number on a dart board and aiming to achive hiting that no. til I was zoned in! That really
                really helped for IN THE MOMENT focus! ~ The work load is daunting but only due toi my tech side still slower that everything else! I understand alot more than i can action at the mo. I dont look at it as a work load more of a list of
                learning tasks I am finding it challenginging but work is work and this is learning to me it hurts my brain but i am enjoying every second!
            <p> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way. ~ I will be attending course as often as possible during foundations. Its an environment I like being in an small things I learn their off peers can often lead to large
                breakthroughs! ~ Ill be on slack more, the first week was brilliant and helpped me alot and ill communicate with facilitators MORE FREQUENTLY IF I CAN NOT GET THROUGH A BLOCK! - A description of what I expect from the facilitation
                team. ~ My expectaions are more on the core I know they know the tech I need to be able to feel confident to aproach peole for help, able to talk and be understood. ~ Those are my expectation along with open minded non-judgmental communication
                for all surrounding me at course etc!
