**Descriptions of above and dictations**

   My plan needs to be based on a Fortnight period as this is dictated by my kids roster of 50/50 with their father. The written below is made up of 3 main factors. 
   - Kids dpendant (meaning) My kids in my care and home.
   - Kids semi dpendant (meaning) my kids in my care but not dependant on me imediatly (school or out of house). 
   - Non Kids (meaning) my off week.  
   I have my kids 50/50 over a fornight but not a straight 7 days. We chop n change through the week. This means a lil bit of planning!  
   I have all but cut off any thing else in my life but whats below is all thats left to schedule around.
     
 **My son Luke** is 8 on May 4th i'd love to keep that Sat free for him I also have a stupidly timed trip away with my daughter in July right on final boot camp week so I will change that to later in July, I need to save up the funds! 
 
 As the week/s progressI will have to make decisions on working or not and fill the slots and move time around as needed but always with 40 hrs dedicated to study. Having more time in my off week dosent mean much. If I dont retrain myself to stick to routine plan my hours even with no restricted days then Ill just be frazzled and procrastination sets in. I eliminate time with the thought process of 'Its Wed I still have 4+ days with 24 hrs a day to fit the remanding 30+ hours in....' this is classic "kandace" procras-logic. The only way I know I will complete Bootcamp is to be disciplined. I must stick to what I obligate myself to achieve.
