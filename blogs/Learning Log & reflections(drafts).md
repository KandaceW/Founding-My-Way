# Learning Log begins April 2019

## April 10 3am

So I have been doing the pre curriculum Student prep. Both Tech and Core!
A lot I am familiar with due to briefly starting this course in the past! What I have tried hard to do and learned from this evening is to really gain a sense of forward motion that I am happy with. To gain a feeling confidence to go into orientation with at least some technical understanding. A lot of what I have done practically is the Tech, this to gain the skills needed but after reading through a lot of the material provided for the Core aspects I have been given a great boost in confidence to know that the way I operate when applying myself to new things is actually normal and by recognising these characteristics in myself as being fairly common and normal has made me more aware and also able to find answers or suggestions to help me retrain my way of thinking, acting, doing and learning!

Yesterday/last night I did not start off writing goals and challenges but I know what I set out to achieve tonight and I new my challenges so Ill just tell you now as I answer the questions I endeavour to ask myself as often as I can every day!

I wanted to get through majority of the tech prep work! 

I wanted that to include all the set up of my email and create new accts needed for foundations. Complete corrospondence with Ollie. 

I wanted to actually understand a heap of Tech and read through All of the setup Core, Pre student prep etc to have a total general knowledge and decide what was best to start with!

I actually achieved all I wanted to and feel great from it!

My challenges I new would be my procrastination and discipline. My focus. My understanding and skill level required to achieve and my lifestyle with kids and other home and work life commitments! 

I waited till I could sit in silence and focus being when kids go down for sleep. 

I work best at night and I enjoy no distractions.

I have been up all night but I will get a couple hours sleep now, get up and send my kids to school and get my work load of a few hours done which leaVES ME free to come back after lunch with a fresh approach and start my work again! 

I will be ready for orientation easy by tomorrow evening! I am just about done as is!
