Hi So my technical blog for sp-3 is describing in human form the difference between Html and css, discussing Control flow and loop, The DOM da dad DOM, accessing Data from Arrays and objects and explaining functions. Lets begin…. Imagine that your going
to build a building for your new business! Html is the layout the plan the founding, solid structure of a building, the initial basic blueprint! Without it where would you start, Css is the materials needed and the structure to reninforce the html foundation
plan its the framing of each floor or aspect needed to put together a well build p[roduct. Its the walls and the paint job to make it not only look real but become real. The functionality of all the doors and locks and lifts etc are still to be activated
by Java script and console but that’s basically how I can explain the difference between css and html! I understand my analogy do you?? Control, flow and Looping! I do this in a consultation with clients prior to the process Ill conduct when doing a hair
color or cut so its a little easier for me to explain relating to that. First off a clear understanding needs to be established and accomplished between two people- the right questions need to be asked, they need to be clear and direct and require the
persons answer to be direct and straight to the pointed needed. When in control of the consultation I will start by asking one question and listening to the answer with no interruption, I will return with an answer which is the looping part this answer
is what they just described to me but how I in my own terms have interpreted what they said. When I am finished they loop back confirming if I am on their level. After this my consultation can continue for many more questions and rounds of looping or
maybe we connect easy and only a few more are needed until we are both happy with the direction we need to take, the course of action required the pros cons and from my professional point of view my input and opinions and advice all taken into account.
Proceeding with both in a clear view of the expected outcome! This is a lil more invested than the flow of teeth toilet and bed structure I use with my kids every night! DOM - Document object model, its a digital folder containing every aspect needed
and contributed to a project related to web development. The way you interact with it is vast so I guess you would pick one aspect of it and go from their! In this case lets go with inspecting a page. already we are interacting with the DOM. We can make
changes and add files and manipulate elements. Use technologies like console.log and develop css styling sheets. Research others code and styles and designs. Figure out options and collect data. The list of ability within the DOM is endless. To describe
accessing Data for arrays and object may start with what they are!! After doing the free code camp and majority of the java course I would have like to have more confidence with this part of my blog but here we go with my basic understanding. Arrays are
essentially an advance Variable.. I think.. with an array you can store multiple values to one variable essentially compiling similar variables and values to essentially simplify code although I think it’s confusing right now. To access the info you need
to know how to write out the equation with correct syntax etc. An Object is ….properties, properties being the connection between names and values like the result you get from combining names aka keys and values! I am still wrapping my head around this!
Again to access the info you need to know how to write out the equation with correct syntax and ask the writ question in computer language to gain the required info. FUNCTIONS….. The basis of javascript I think. Its kinda like a set of statements creating
a defined action um um um how to put it. You need to define things to make a function work its a structure to produce a result. If I could write out a simple function it would be this function myVar(dog, cat) { return dog + cat; } This comes back undefined
as its not a defined variable but I am still grasping all this so Ill leave that as my basic explanation and If I could be more clear I would infect let me think for just a min and ill go to my console and have a quick play That didn’t help Ill have to
work on this answer! I know they are useful because they are used to find out information!
