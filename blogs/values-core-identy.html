                <h1>My core identity and values blog</h1>
                <p> First off let me start with the value I hold in 
                        the most highest regard is without a doubt loyalty.̉
                        This word is thrown around and disrespected by 
                        many but for me it is everything. 
                        It can represent many other important values including 
                        integrity and honesty. Two more words I hold dear to me. 
                        I feel if you show loyalty to something,
                        someone or even somewhere then this must
                        mean its important to you. Or you have a
                        connection or a history that defines a small
                        or large part of you. If you have to earn
                        loyalty or have your loyalty be earned it
                        must mean something to you and the other
                        party. Why is it such a big deal? To uphold
                        loyalty is not hard, but it is rear and it
                        is something that I have tried my entire
                        life to keep my standards high and not let
                        influences tell me what I feel to be true or
                        false. I don’t give my loyalty away but I
                        let it grow with anybody I meet. Everything
                        and everyone has the ability to gain my
                        loyalty and give in return. I define Loyalty
                        by some key words trustworthy 
                        dependable accountable, honest, integrity and
                        unbreakable. In any case if you are loyal
                        you will make the right decision for that
                        moment.
                    </p>
                        <br>
                    <p> An example that I can think of to
                        display loyalty from my perspective. 
                        Im in a room,someone that I do care 
                        for maybe gets mentioned perhaps
                        incorrectly or negativly and false. I
                        would stick up for my friend in
                        their absence. I would correct
                        whatever was being said. I would not
                        participate in any conversation
                        about someone unless I was willing 
                        to say it to their face and I am not 
                        shy to speak the truth to anyone. 
                        My loyalty is within myself I will
                        never go behind a friends back.   
                        Another example I can think of from
                        my 21st birthday party (I don’t 
                        remember much about my 21st) what I do 
                        remember is the first few lines out of my 
                        Fathers mouth during his speech. 
                        He started off with “If there is one 
                        thing I could not say enough times 
                        over and the one thing that will not faulter
                        is her tenacious and relentless Loyalty                      
                        she shows to those dear to her. It                       
                        is unbreakable and with that loyalty                       
                        if you have her on side she will                      
                        make one hell of a guard dog“ he                       
                        was and is right. My outspoken                       
                        forward and assertive nature in-fact                       
                        can be to my detriment sometimes                       
                        although getting in trouble to up                      
                        hold my values including on another                       
                        behalf is never in my mind going to                      
                        be the wrong decision. 
                    </p>
                    <br>                   
                    <p> Another value and a identity defining                       
                        factor about me is the importance of                       
                        family. The word family means more                       
                        than the people that raised you with                       
                        the same blood. It’s also no doubt a choice.                       
                        I believe that those close to us that                       
                        we love respect and depend on, that                       
                        we want to show loyalty to and care                       
                        for from our hearts are the people                       
                        that matter. They are our Family. I                    
                        firmly believe you can pick your                       
                        family. You are born without choice                       
                        but as you grow and learn and see                       
                        the good and evil in the world its                       
                        important to address the ones you                       
                        love and believe in you and remember                      
                        them. For one day when you may need                       
                        someone if they are true they will                       
                        be there for you. Everything is a                       
                        choice. What and who you put your                       
                        time and energy into will shape you                       
                        and guide you and its all held in                      
                        your Gut and Heart. As far as I’m                   
                        concerned blood does not mean                       
                        family. Its an identifiable quality                       
                        we all have but we also all have out                      
                        own minds and our own hearts and                       
                        souls which far out weigh the red                      
                        running through our veins. We are                       
                        lucky if we have a family that we                      
                        are born into that we can depend on                       
                        it is unfortunately not always this                       
                        way for some but as I said YOU CAN                       
                        CHOOSE and you can establish your                       
                        own roots and guide your own                       
                        children and help shape them and                       
                        create your family with those dear                       
                        to you all around you!

                        Wellington and I am proud of where I                       
                        came from. I am 34 I have two                       
                        children. My beautiful daughter Alexandra 10

                        Alex is an amazing and honest                      
                        soul she is wise and she’s also                       
                        reserved with judgement. Alex is                       
                        extremely close with her cousins and

                        family values about strength in love                      
                        and backing each other. My gorgeous                       
                        girl is an inspiration to me Im more                       
                        than proud.

                    <p> My son Luke, he reminds me the small                       
                        things don’t matter his inner light                       
                        and diversity shine as he                       
                        enters a room so does an energy of positivity.                      
                        He has a natural giving nature and                       
                        just says yes to things.  
                        His acceptance and light heartedness                     
                        make it easy to gain perspective.                      
                        The reason Im sharing with you                       
                        my feelings on my children is to                                             
                        give backing to my own values mentioned                      
                        above. If I see those qualities in                       
                        my children I have done something                       
                        right. I must have a strong influence                      
                        in their way of thinking. I raised                       
                        them so far with their Father of                      
                        course. I believe that strong                      
                        influence from me and everyone                       
                        around them including our self

                        <br>
                    <p> There was a dark time for me
                        towards the end of my Salon ownership
                        I was faced with a dilemma that
                        really challenged me and my
                        values. I had a toddler and a
                        baby and I was facing single
                        motherhood, I battled depression
                        and anxiety and felt torn by my
                        stubborn loyalty to my staff
                        and business. I felt scared and
                        immense guilt that I was
                        neglecting my kids and I felt
                        ridiculous pressure to uphold
                        responsibilities and
                        obligations to staff whome
                        depended on me for their
                        livelihoods. I realised
                        pride was playing a big factor and when
                        I spoke with my staff they
                        showed me compassion. Said that they
                        were thankful for me regardless
                        and to do what is right! I sold
                        the business and moved forward
                        in my life and spent my time
                        focused on my kids and I. I
                        remained self employed but on a
                        home basis and have done this for
                        the past 5-6 years. I don’t
                        regret a thing now and I learnt
                        a lot and consider it one of the
                        hardest phases in my life. Its
                        hard to think that for a few
                        years when my kids were little
                        and I owned a business, ran uoto 6
                        staff, obeyed the law
                        requirments, managed client
                        relationships and a challenging
                        personal relationships and more. I was
                        actually un happy person, both
                        within myself and outwardly to
                        the world. I am an emotional
                        person and this stirs up many
                        memories some painful, there are many
                        feelings and thoughts related to that
                        time.

                    <p> This is another reason EDA is
                        were I want to be. To ask this
                        of me shows they are wanting the
                        right things from me as I do
                        from them. People are the reason
                        websites exist not technology
                        People are what matter! I want
                        to be apart of the future and
                        shaping people in any way
                        including through Technology!
                        Thanks to the Dev Whanau for
                        even just existing!
