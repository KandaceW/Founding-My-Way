       My Name is Kandace im 34 a mother of 2 a Hairsdresser for 18 years and re establishing life through education and "keeping with the times" f to display what to me is loyalty from my perspective is maybe the situation is I am in a room and someone that I do care for maybe gets mentioned  and perhaps in an incorrect and negative light, I  would stick up for my friend  in their absence. I would correct whatever was being said. I would not participate in any conversation about someone unless I was willing to say it to their face and I am not shy to speak the truth to anyone. My loyalty is within myself I will never go behind a friends back. Another example I can think of from the mouth of another is on my 21st  birthday party (sorry but I don’t remember much about my 21st) what I do remember is the first few lines out of my Fathers mouth during his speech. He started off with “ If there is one thing I could not say enough times over and the one thing that will not falter with Kandace is her tenacious and relentless Loyalty she she’s to those dear to her. It is unbreakable and with that loyalty if you have her on side she will make one hell of a guard dog “ he was and is right. My outspoken forward and assertive nature in-fact can be to my detriment sometimes although getting in trouble to up hold my values including on another behalf is never in my mind going to be the wrong decision.
