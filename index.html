                                <p> First off let me start with the value I hold in 
                                    the most highest regard is without a doubt loyalty.̉
                                    This word is thrown around and disrespected by 
                                    many but for me it is everything. 
                                    It can represent many other important values including 
                                    integrity and honesty. Two more words I hold dear to me. 
                                    I feel if you show loyalty to something,
                                    someone or even somewhere then this must
                                    mean its important to you. Or you have a
                                    connection or a history that defines a small
                                    or large part of you. If you have to earn
                                    loyalty or have your loyalty be earned it
                                    must mean something to you and the other
                                    party. Why is it such a big deal? To uphold
                                    loyalty is not hard, but it is rear and it
                                    is something that I have tried my entire
                                    life to keep my standards high and not let
                                    influences tell me what I feel to be true or
                                    false. I don’t give my loyalty away but I
                                    let it grow with anybody I meet. Everything
                                    and everyone has the ability to gain my
                                    loyalty and give in return. I define Loyalty
                                    by some key words trustworthy 
                                    dependable accountable, honest, integrity and
                                    unbreakable. In any case if you are loyal
                                    you will make the right decision for that
                                    moment.
                                </p>
                                    <br>
                                <p> An example that I can think of to
                                    display loyalty from my perspective. 
                                    Im in a room,someone that I do care 
                                    for maybe gets mentioned perhaps
                                    incorrectly or negativly and false. I
                                    would stick up for my friend in
                                    their absence. I would correct
                                    whatever was being said. I would not
                                    participate in any conversation
                                    about someone unless I was willing 
                                    to say it to their face and I am not 
                                    shy to speak the truth to anyone. 
                                    My loyalty is within myself I will
                                    never go behind a friends back.   
                                    Another example I can think of from
                                    my 21st birthday party (I don’t 
                                    remember much about my 21st) what I do 
                                    remember is the first few lines out of my 
                                    Fathers mouth during his speech. 
                                    He started off with “If there is one 
                                    thing I could not say enough times 
                                    over and the one thing that will not faulter
                                    is her tenacious and relentless Loyalty                      
                                    she shows to those dear to her. It                       
                                    is unbreakable and with that loyalty                       
                                    if you have her on side she will                      
                                    make one hell of a guard dog“ he                       
                                    was and is right. My outspoken                       
                                    forward and assertive nature in-fact                       
                                    can be to my detriment sometimes                       
                                    although getting in trouble to up                      
                                    hold my values including on another                       
                                    behalf is never in my mind going to                      
                                    be the wrong decision. 
                                </p>

                                <p> Another value and a identity defining                       
                                    factor about me is the importance of                       
                                    family. The word family means more                       
                                    than the people that raised you with                       
                                    the same blood. It’s also no doubt a choice.                       
                                    I believe that those close to us that                       
                                    we love respect and depend on, that                       
                                    we want to show loyalty to and care                       
                                    for from our hearts are the people                       
                                    that matter. They are our Family. I                    
                                    firmly believe you can pick your                       
                                    family. You are born without choice                       
                                    but as you grow and learn and see                       
                                    the good and evil in the world its                       
                                    important to address the ones you                       
                                    love and believe in you and remember                      
                                    them. For one day when you may need                       
                                    someone if they are true they will                       
                                    be there for you. Everything is a                       
                                    choice. What and who you put your                       
                                    time and energy into will shape you                       
                                    and guide you and its all held in                      
                                    your Gut and Heart. As far as I’m                   
                                    concerned blood does not mean                       
                                    family. Its an identifiable quality                       
                                    we all have but we also all have out                      
                                    own minds and our own hearts and                       
                                    souls which far out weigh the red                      
                                    running through our veins. We are                       
                                    lucky if we have a family that we                      
                                    are born into that we can depend on                       
                                    it is unfortunately not always this                       
                                    way for some but as I said YOU CAN                       
                                    CHOOSE and you can establish your                       
                                    own roots and guide your own                       
                                    children and help shape them and                       
                                    create your family with those dear

                                    He has a natural giving nature and                       
                                    just says yes to things.  
                                    His acceptance and light heartedness                     
                                    make it easy to gain perspective.                      
                                    The reason Im sharing with you                       
                                    my feelings on my children is to                                             
                                    give backing to my own values mentioned                      
                                    above. If I see those qualities in                       
                                    my children I have done something                       
                                    right. I must have a strong influence                      
                                    in their way of thinking. I raised                       
                                    them so far with their Father of                      
                                    course. I believe that strong                      
                                    influence from me and everyone                       
                                    around them including our self                      
                                    appointed family members, their                      
                                    community surrounding us are all an

                                <p> There was a dark time for me
                                    towards the end of my Salon ownership
                                    I was faced with a dilemma that
                                    really challenged me and my
                                    values. I had a toddler and a
                                    baby and I was facing single
                                    motherhood, I battled depression
                                    and anxiety and felt torn by my
                                    stubborn loyalty to my staff
                                    and business. I felt scared and
                                    immense guilt that I was
                                    neglecting my kids and I felt
                                    ridiculous pressure to uphold
                                    responsibilities and
                                    obligations to staff whome
                                    depended on me for their
                                    livelihoods. I realised
                                    pride was playing a big factor and when
                                    I spoke with my staff they
                                    showed me compassion. Said that they
                                    were thankful for me regardless
                                    and to do what is right! I sold
                                    the business and moved forward
                                    in my life and spent my time
                                    focused on my kids and I. I
                                    remained self employed but on a
                                    home basis and have done this for
                                    the past 5-6 years. I don’t
                                    regret a thing now and I learnt
                                    a lot and consider it one of the
                                    hardest phases in my life. Its
                                    hard to think that for a few
                                    years when my kids were little
                                    and I owned a business, ran uoto 6
                                    staff, obeyed the law
                                    requirments, managed client
                                    relationships and a challenging
                                    personal relationships and more. I was
                                    actually un happy person, both
                                    within myself and outwardly to
                                    the world. I am an emotional
                                    person and this stirs up many
                                    memories some painful, there are many
                                    feelings and thoughts related to that
                                    time.

                                <p> This is another reason EDA is
                                    were I want to be. To ask this
                                    of me shows they are wanting the
                                    right things from me as I do
                                    from them. People are the reason
                                    websites exist not technology
                                    People are what matter! I want
                                    to be apart of the future and
                                    shaping people in any way
                                    including through Technology!
